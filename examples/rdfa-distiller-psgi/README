This is a PSGI application that provides an RDFa "distiller". That is,
a web service that consumes RDFa and emits some serialisation of RDF.

PSGI applications can be run via CGI (a CGI wrapper is provided), via
dedicated PSGI web servers (such as Starman and Gepok), via the
"plackup" command-line tool, via Apache mod_perl, and many other ways.

This distiller supports RDFa 1.0 and 1.1 embedded in all the host
languages supported by RDF::RDFa::Parser, and is able to produce
output in RDF/XML, Turtle, N-Triples and RDF/JSON serialisations. If
RDF::RDFa::Generator is installed, then it can even produce XHTML+RDFa
output.

If you plan on using this application in a production environment,
please change the e-mail address on line 16 of app.psgi.
