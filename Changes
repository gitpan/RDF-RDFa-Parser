Bug tracker:  <http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=RDF-RDFa-Parser>
Maintainer:   Toby Inkster <mailto:tobyink@cpan.org>

1.095 [2011-09-23] # RDFa 1.1 Release Candidate 5
 - (Addition Update) Add 'vocab_triple' option, and enable it for RDFa 1.1.
 - (Addition Update) Add 'src_sets_object' option, and enable it for RDFa
   1.1.
 - (Update) Change 'profiles' option to 'profile_attr', and disable it for
   RDFa 1.1 to match forthcoming WD.
 - (Addition Update) RDF::RDFa::Parser::Profile::RDFa11 for the default
   RDFa 1.1 profile.
 - (Addition Update) Add 'inlist_attr' option, and enable it for RDFa 1.1.
   This enables support for RDF Collections.
 - (Removal) RDF::RDFa::Parser no longer does any HTTP caching. Caching
   should be handled at the application level.

1.094 [2011-02-09] # RDFa 1.1 Release Candidate 4
 - Issue warning when encountering a profile URI contains a fragment
   identifier.
 - Issue warning when encountering a profile that is not a valid URI.
 - The opengraph method now returns the first value in the list when called
   in scalar context. (Previously returned an arrayref.)
 - (Bugfix) @prefix wasn't working - ignored all but the first prefix.
 - (Documentation Update) Copyright 2011.
 - (Documentation) Improve SYNOPSIS section.
 - (Addition) The opengraph method now recognises the old Open Graph
   Protocol namespace for better backcompat.
 - (Update) Support new RDFa 1.1 feature where XMLLiterals are recursed
   into.
 - (Addition) Include 'tagsoup' configuration set for dealing with content
   from the wild.

1.093 [2010-12-09] # RDFa 1.1 Release Candidate 3
 - @graph is now parsed like @about by default.
 - Change cache directory.
 - Clarify language around default prefix versus default vocabulary (or in
   RDFa 1.0 default prefix versus 'no prefix'). This involved renaming a
   couple of configuration options: prefix_default => vocab_default;
   prefix_empty => prefix_default.
 - Deprecated pretriple_literal and pretriple_resource callbacks - use
   ontriple instead.
 - IETF link types now use an aggressively cached copy of
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml.
 - Improve HTTP caching behaviour.
 - Second parameter to ontriple callback is now a hashref of elements
   rather than just the current element - this change is to help support
   the RDFa API.
 - Use official GRDDL profile URI for hard-coded support for GRDDL keywords
   instead of previously used internal identifier.
 - (Bugfix) new_from_url didn't work when called without a Config object.
 - (Addition) Support @cite - not part of RDFa, but often provides useful
   information.
 - (Bugfix) Fix failure parsing embedded RDF/XML with blank nodes.
 - (Addition) Support @longdesc - not part of RDFa, but often provides
   useful information.

1.092 [2010-10-20] # RDFa 1.1 Release Candidate 2
 - If @graph support is enabled, and RDFa attributes are being used in a
   non-standard namespace, assume @graph is in that namespace too.
 - Load Profile modules via Module::Pluggable.
 - RDFa Profiles establish both a case-sensitive and case-insensitive term
   mapping.
 - Reimplement RDFa 1.0 keyword concept using profiles.
 - Strongly deprecate keyword_bundles config option - use default_profiles
   instead.
 - (Bugfix) The final prefix defined in @prefix was being ignored due to a
   regexp bug. Fixed.
 - (Bugfix) There was an inconsistency between the code and documentation
   for the name of the oncurie/ontoken callback. It's now called ontoken.
