1.096_03  2012-05-20  # RDFa 1.1 Release Candidate 6.03

 - (Addition) New output_graph and processor_and_output_graph methods.
 - (Addition) RDF::RDFa::Parser Distiller PSGI in the 'examples' directory.
 - (Bugfix) Fix crash in RDFa version guessing.
 - (Packaging) Lots more work on 'xt' tests - can now output EARL, which is
   bundled in the 'meta' directory of the release.
 - Allow unparsable markup (i.e. DOM cannot be generated) to result in a
   simple error (reported via error callbacks, etc) rather than croaking.
 - ERR_CODE_CURIE_UNDEFINED is now a warning, not an error.
 - Slight improvements to processor_graph, to allow it to pass test cases
   from RDFa 1.1 test suite.

1.096_02  2012-05-17  # RDFa 1.1 Release Candidate 6.02

 - (Addition) XHTML5 is now a host language in its own right - a mashup
   between HTML5 and XHTML1, but with added xml:base support.
 - (Bugfix) The xml:base attribute was being ignored in a few places when
   it shouldn't have been.
 - (Packaging) Now passing RDFa 1.1 test suite for RDFa 1.1 in XML, SVG and

   identifier, instead treat as a weird URI.

   in HTML4, HTML5 and XHTML1 ('xt' tests, available in repo but not on
   CPAN).
 - (Packaging) Start cleaning up 'examples' directory.
 - (Removal) Dropped a little relative URI resolution hack that I don't
   think is needed any more.
 - (Removal) Remove @profile support, plus entire profile mechanism.

1.094  2011-02-09  # RDFa 1.1 Release Candidate 4

 - (Addition) Include 'tagsoup' configuration set for dealing with content
   from the wild.

   Protocol namespace for better backcompat.

   information.
 - (Addition) Support @longdesc - not part of RDFa, but often provides
   useful information.
 - (Bugfix) Fix failure parsing embedded RDF/XML with blank nodes.
 - (Bugfix) new_from_url didn't work when called without a Config object.
 - @graph is now parsed like @about by default.
 - Change cache directory.

   RDFa 1.0 default prefix versus 'no prefix'). This involved renaming a
   couple of configuration options: prefix_default => vocab_default;
   prefix_empty => prefix_default.
 - Deprecated pretriple_literal and pretriple_resource callbacks - use
   ontriple instead.
 - IETF link types now use an aggressively cached copy of
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml.
 - Improve HTTP caching behaviour.
 - Second parameter to ontriple callback is now a hashref of elements
   rather than just the current element - this change is to help support
   the RDFa API.

   instead of previously used internal identifier.

1.092  2010-10-20  # RDFa 1.1 Release Candidate 2

   non-standard namespace, assume @graph is in that namespace too.
 - Load Profile modules via Module::Pluggable.
 - RDFa Profiles establish both a case-sensitive and case-insensitive term
   mapping.
 - Reimplement RDFa 1.0 keyword concept using profiles.
 - Strongly deprecate keyword_bundles config option - use default_profiles
   instead.
